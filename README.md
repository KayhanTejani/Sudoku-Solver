## Sudoku Game & Solver

A playable Sudoku game with a UI with a **solve** feature that can solve any game using backtracking.

Run GUI.py to play Sudoku.

### Instructions

Click a box and enter the number on your keybaord to pencil in a number. To confirm that number press the ENTER key. To delete a number in a box, you can press the DELETE key. Finally to solve the board, press SPACE and visualize the algorithm solve the board.

### Why build a solver?

**Backtracking** is one of the most important algorithmic techniques used for solving problems recursively. This **solver** feature helps to simplify how backtracking works by visualizing how a Sudoku board can be solved recursively. Each slot in the Sudoku board is solved incrementally, checking at each step if every entry on the board satisfies the Sudoku game rules.
