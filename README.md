### Why build a solver?

**Backtracking** is one of the most important algorithmic techniques used for solving problems recursively. This **solver** feature helps to simplify how backtracking works by visualizing how a Sudoku board can be solved recursively. Each slot in the Sudoku board is solved incrementally, checking at each step if every entry on the board satisfies the Sudoku game rules.
